## Notes and Decisions

### User Preferences Captured
- All code examples in Python
- Sudoku solver for Exercise 3
- Verbose examples should reach ~200 lines
- Mixed student levels (don't overwhelm beginners, but don't dumb down)
- Exercise 4: Let students discover limitations organically
- No test files, just disclaimer comments
- Each exercise gets its own README
- Commit after each exercise completes
