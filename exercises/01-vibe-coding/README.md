# Exercise 1: Vibe Coding

## Purpose
Have a first experience of agentic AI development by solving straightforward programming problems with an AI assistant.

## Overview
This exercise introduces you to working with AI coding assistants through a series of trivial programming tasks. Each task is designed to be completed quickly (under 5 minutes) in a single interaction with your AI agent. The goal is to develop an intuitive feel for what AI can do quickly and easily.

## Learning Objectives
- Familiarize yourself with your AI agent's interface and capabilities
- Experience rapid problem-solving with AI assistance
- Understand what types of problems are amenable to single-pass AI solutions
- Practice articulating requirements clearly to the AI
- Develop intuition for AI-assisted coding workflows

## Instructions

### Setup
1. Choose an AI coding assistant (Claude, GitHub Copilot, ChatGPT, etc.)
2. Set up your Python development environment
3. Create a working directory for your solutions

### The Exercise

1. **Review the tasks** in `tasks.md` - there are 15 trivial coding tasks covering various domains:
   - File and directory manipulation
   - Data format conversion
   - Text processing and analysis
   - Web/API interactions
   - System utilities

2. **Start with the simplest tasks first.** We recommend beginning with:
   - Task 1: Bulk File Renamer
   - Task 2: CSV to JSON Converter
   - Task 5: Word Frequency Counter

3. **For each task:**
   - Read the specification carefully
   - Ask your AI agent to implement the solution
   - Review the generated code - does it make sense?
   - Test the solution with sample data
   - Ask the AI to explain its approach if anything is unclear

4. **Experiment and explore:**
   - Try modifying requirements slightly to see how the AI adapts
   - Ask follow-up questions about the code
   - Request alternative implementations
   - Challenge the AI with edge cases

5. **Reflect:**
   - Which tasks did the AI solve most easily?
   - Were there any surprises in the solutions?
   - How clear did you need to be with your requirements?
   - What patterns did you notice in effective prompts?

## Reference Solutions

The `solutions/` directory contains reference Python implementations for some tasks. These are provided:
- To verify your AI-generated solutions work correctly
- As examples of clean, working code
- To compare approaches when the AI produces something different

**Note:** Don't look at the reference solutions until you've attempted the task with your AI agent first. The learning happens in the interaction.

## Tips for Success

- **Be specific:** Give the AI clear, unambiguous requirements
- **Start simple:** Begin with the easiest tasks to build confidence
- **Ask questions:** If you don't understand the solution, ask the AI to explain
- **Test thoroughly:** Always test with real data, including edge cases
- **Iterate quickly:** If something doesn't work, describe the issue and ask for fixes
- **Stay curious:** Experiment with variations and alternative approaches

## What to Notice

Pay attention to:
- How much detail you need to provide vs. what the AI infers
- Which types of tasks the AI handles most smoothly
- When you need to intervene or provide clarification
- Patterns in successful prompts and interactions
- Your own understanding after reviewing AI-generated code

## Time Estimate

- Complete exercise: 1-2 hours
- Individual tasks: 5-10 minutes each (including testing)

## Next Steps

After completing this exercise:
- Reflect on what types of problems were easy vs. challenging
- Consider what made some tasks more straightforward than others
- Think about how you might break larger problems into "vibe coding" sized chunks
- Move on to Exercise 2 to practice evaluating problem complexity
