## Template Instructions

**How to use this template:**

1. Copy this file to your project directory
2. Fill in the header information
3. Update after each work session
4. Be honest about what worked and what didn't
5. Focus on learning, not just accomplishment
6. Include enough detail for future-you to understand what happened
7. Document blockers and failures—they're valuable learning

**Tips:**
- Update in real-time or immediately after sessions while fresh
- Be specific about challenges (vague notes aren't helpful later)
- Include code snippets or command snippets that were useful
- Track time realistically
- Celebrate small wins
- Don't judge yourself—this is about learning

**Remember:** This document is for YOUR learning. Be thorough and honest.
