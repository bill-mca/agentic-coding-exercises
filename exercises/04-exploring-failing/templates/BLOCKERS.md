## Pattern Recognition

After encountering multiple blockers, patterns may emerge.

**Common themes:**
- [Pattern 1: e.g., "Often underestimate integration complexity"]
- [Pattern 2: e.g., "APIs rarely work as documented"]
- [Pattern 3]

**Early warning signs:**
- [Sign that something will be harder than expected]
- [Sign that you're going down the wrong path]

**Effective strategies:**
- [What tends to work when stuck]
- [When to pivot vs. persist]

## Tips for Using This Document

**When to add a blocker:**
- When you've been stuck for more than 30 minutes
- When you realize something won't work as planned
- When you discover a hard limitation
- When you need to decide whether to pivot

**How to write good blocker descriptions:**
- Be specific about what you tried
- Include error messages or symptoms
- Note what you've already ruled out
- Document the exact context (versions, environment, etc.)

**Using blockers with AI:**
- Share the blocker description with AI for suggestions
- Ask AI to explain error messages or concepts
- Have AI critique your attempted solutions
- But recognize when AI is guessing vs. knowing

**Remember:**
- Blockers are learning opportunities, not failures
- Documenting blockers helps you and helps others
- Some blockers are signs to pivot, not persist
- Your time is valuable—know when to move on
